### About the game

The design of the game was mainly decided with the phaser3 space shooter tutorial. The design was expanded to have more than one live and save the score of game.

### Design

this is a simple pixel game made using low-quality version ships and assets from the![OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/) page.

our player is a starship ![starship](./assets/starship.svg) that most defeat enemies by shooting them lasers ![torpedo](./assets/torpedo.svg).

in this game we have to face 3 kinds of enemies which are the following:

* A chaser ship that follows the player when it gets to close ![ufo](./assets/ufo.svg).
* An evil dark ufo, who will constantly shoot at you ![ufodark](./assets/ufodark.svg). Be careful of their lasers ![laser](./assets/projectile1.svg)
* An enemy starship that does not shoot but will hurt the player if you crash with it![darkstarship](./assets/starshipdark.svg)

### Future Features

* add more enemies
* save the score online
* make the game more difficult as the game progresses
* separate ES6 modules
